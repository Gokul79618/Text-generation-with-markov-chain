# Text-generation-with-markov-chain
Markov Chain-based text generation is a statistical method for generating text that mimics the style and structure of a given input dataset (such as a paragraph, article, or book). It relies on the concept of Markov chains, where the next state (word or character) depends only on the current state, not the entire history.
